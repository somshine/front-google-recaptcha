Find the below core java assignments.

1- Simple Program with pain java class (or classes)

Greet the user and show date/time
Take numeric input from the user 
1-	add
a.	if =1, ask numbers to add (n) and blank to end. After blank input, provide them the result on screen
2-	subtract
a.	if =2, ask 2 numbers to Subtract, after second number, provide them the result on screen (A-B). 

3-	div
a.	if =3, ask 2 numbers to Subtract, after second number, provide them the result on screen (A/B). Check exceptions.


4-	Multiply
a.	if =4, ask numbers to add (n) and blank to end. After blank input, provide them the result on screen


5-	shape
a.	1. Circle
i.	Enter Radius, provide area as the result
b.	Rectangle
i.	Enter length of two sides, provide area as the result


7 – Repeat


Anything else  - Exit

Flush all entries and results to a file in current directory. Keep appending to the same file if the program executes from the same directory next time (don’t overwrite)
Take date format from properties file (SimpleDateFormat)

2- In above example try to have interface approach.

3- In above example try to have abstract class approach.

4- In above example insert exception handling properly. First use inbuild exception and then create your own exception for message on console.

7- Show how we serialize the object and store in a file or local harddisk. Show how can create an object from it using deserialize interface. understand externalization concept and its method.

8- One core java example which at least show the following design pattern concept. Make sure don’t  just copy from net... try to understand its use case and where to use and why to use.
                              '- Behavior :- Adaptor, Bridge, Proxy, Facade, Flyweight
                              '- Structural :- Iterator, Mediator, Chain of responsibility
                              '- Creational :- Singleton, Prototype, Factory, Builder Pattern  (Please don’t copy from the net understand the concept and then create your own need and justification where to use it.
                              
9- Example showing Sorting concept on collection with api and using your own program i.e. using comparable and comparator interface.

10- Show the example of creating object in java using new, cloneable interface, class.forname and deserialize interface.
